# ðŸŒŸ Polynomial Regression â€“ Student Marks Prediction

This project demonstrates the application of **Polynomial Regression** to model and predict studentsâ€™ marks based on their study hours. By extending the linear model to higher polynomial degrees, it captures nonlinear patterns. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model fitting with polynomial features, evaluation using regression metrics, and rich visual outputs for interpretability.

##  Results  
Polynomial Regression models (especially degree 2 and 3) often better capture the relationship between study hours and marks, particularly when trends are nonlinear.  
- MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² are computed and compared across models.  
- Visual plots help you quickly assess model fit and prediction accuracy.
