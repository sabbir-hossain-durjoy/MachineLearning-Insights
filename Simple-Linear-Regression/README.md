# ðŸ“Š Simple Linear Regression â€“ Student Marks Prediction  

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple Linear Regression** to analyze and predict studentsâ€™ marks based on their study hours. The model is trained on a cleaned dataset, evaluated using standard regression metrics, and supported by comprehensive visualizations for performance interpretation.  

## ðŸ”Ž Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset.  
- **Model Training**: Applying simple linear regression with a clear regression line.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.  
- **Visualization**: Scatter plots, regression fit, residuals, and prediction comparisons.  
- **Extendable**: Can be easily upgraded to polynomial or multiple regression models.  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  
You can run this project directly in Google Colab.  
When opened, youâ€™ll be able to view the **full source code** and explore the **visualizations of the outputs** step by step.
