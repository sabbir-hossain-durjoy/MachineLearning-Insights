ðŸ“Š Simple Linear Regression â€“ Student Marks Prediction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression to analyze and predict studentsâ€™ marks based on their study hours. The model is trained on a cleaned dataset, evaluated using standard regression metrics, and supported by comprehensive visualizations for performance interpretation.

ðŸ”Ž Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset.

Model Training: Applying simple linear regression with a clear regression line.

Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.

Visualization: Scatter plots, regression fit, residuals, and prediction comparisons.

Extendable: Can be easily upgraded to polynomial or multiple regression models.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Open the notebook in Google Colab to explore the complete code, run the model, and view all visualizations of the outputs:
