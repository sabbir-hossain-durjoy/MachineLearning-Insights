# 🤖 MachineLearning-Insights

A hands-on collection of **Machine Learning algorithms** implemented in Python.  

I’ve implemented and explained several **core ML algorithms** with **detailed code**, **outputs (visualized as GIFs)**, and **Google Colab links** for hands-on practice.  
The goal of this repository is to make ML concepts **interactive, visual, and easy to understand**.
