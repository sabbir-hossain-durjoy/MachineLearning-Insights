# 🌲 Random Forest Classifier — Breast Cancer Diagnosis

This project applies a **Random Forest Classifier** to the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset for predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign. Random Forest, an ensemble of decision trees, improves accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree. The notebook includes **data exploration, training, evaluation, feature importance, and visualizations** for deeper insights.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🧭 **Data Exploration** – Dataset overview (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`), null-value checks  
- 🔀 **Train/Test Split** – Stratified 70/30 split for reliable evaluation  
- 🌲 **Random Forest Model** – Ensemble of 100 decision trees with Scikit-Learn  
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics** – Accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score  
- 📊 **Confusion Matrix** – Visual evaluation of predictions  
- ⭐ **Feature Importance** – Top predictors for diagnosis  
- 🎨 **Visualizations** – Class distribution & correlation heatmap  
- 🔮 **Sample Prediction** – Test with a real patient’s data row
