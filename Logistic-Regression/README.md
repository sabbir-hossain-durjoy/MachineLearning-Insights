# ðŸ“˜ Student Marks Prediction â€“ Linear Regression  

This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** to model and predict studentsâ€™ marks based on their study hours. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations to interpret results.

## âœ¨ Features  
- ðŸ“‚ **Data Loading** â€“ Reads dataset directly from Google Drive in Colab.  
- ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handles missing values by imputing the mean of study hours.  
- ðŸ¤– **Model Training** â€“ Trains a **Linear Regression** model to predict marks.  
- ðŸ“Š **Evaluation Metrics** â€“  
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)  
  - RÂ² Score (Goodness of fit)  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Visualizations** â€“  
  - Missing value plots (bar & pie)  
  - Scatter plot with regression line  
  - Trend plots for predicted study hours  
- ðŸ”® **Prediction Interface** â€“ Estimate marks for custom study hours (e.g., 7.5, 8, 9).

## ðŸ“ˆ Results  
- âœ… The model successfully learns the linear relationship between study hours and marks.  
- âœ… Evaluation metrics demonstrate prediction accuracy.  
- âœ… Predictions for custom study hours are clearly visualized.
