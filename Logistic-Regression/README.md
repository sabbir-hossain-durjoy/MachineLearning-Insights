# 🔐 Student Performance Classification – Logistic Regression  

This project demonstrates the use of **Logistic Regression** to classify student outcomes (e.g., pass/fail) based on their study hours or related features. Logistic Regression is a fundamental classification algorithm that estimates probabilities and maps them to categorical outcomes.
