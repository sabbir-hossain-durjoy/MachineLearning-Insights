#  Student Marks Prediction â€“ Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** to model and predict studentsâ€™ marks based on their study hours. The notebook guides you through data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction visualizations.

##  Features  
-  **Data Loading**: Imports the dataset from Google Drive via Colab.  
-  **Missing Value Handling**: Fills missing study hours using the column mean.  
-  **Model Training**: Implements a `LinearRegression` model to predict marks.  
-  **Evaluation Metrics**: Reports Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.  
-  **Visual Insights**:  
  - Missing value visualization (bar and pie charts)  
  - Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted scores  
  - Custom range predictions and their plotted trends  
-  **Prediction Interface**: Quickly estimate marks for given study hour values (e.g., 7.5, 8, 9 hours).

##  Results  
- The model effectively captures the linear relationship between study hours and marks.  
- Model accuracy summarized via MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score.  
- Predictions available for custom input hours, visualized through intuitive plots.
