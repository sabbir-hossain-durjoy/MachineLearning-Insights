# ðŸ“š Logistic Regression â€“ Student Marks Prediction  

This project demonstrates how to use **Logistic Regression** techniques in machine learning to predict student marks based on their study hours. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions for better interpretability.

## âœ¨ Features  
- ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handling missing values with mean imputation.  
- ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Analysis** â€“ Missing value bar & pie plots.  
- ðŸ¤– **Model Training** â€“ Training and testing with Scikit-Learn regression.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Evaluation Metrics** â€“ Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Visualizations** â€“ Scatter plots, regression lines, and prediction curves.  
- ðŸ”® **Prediction** â€“ Make predictions for study hours.

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- The regression model learns the relationship between **study hours** and **student marks**.  
- Predictions can be made for any input study hours.  
- Key metrics (MAE, MSE, RÂ²) are computed to evaluate model accuracy.
