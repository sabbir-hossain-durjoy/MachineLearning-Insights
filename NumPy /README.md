# 🔢 NumPy Fundamentals – Practice Notebook  

A complete, end-to-end notebook that demonstrates the **core functionalities of NumPy** for numerical computing in Python. It covers **array creation, reshaping, broadcasting, slicing, indexing, random number generation, mathematical operations, and boolean masking**, with hands-on examples.

## ✨ Key Features  

- 🏗️ **Array Creation**  
  - From lists, tuples, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`  
  - Zeros, ones, random arrays  

- 🔄 **Reshaping & Dimensions**  
  - Converting 1D → 2D → 3D arrays  
  - `.reshape()`, `.shape`, `.size`, `.dtype`, `.itemsize`  

- 🎯 **Indexing & Slicing**  
  - 1D and 2D indexing  
  - Negative indices  
  - Subsetting with slices and masks  

- 📈 **Random Number Generation**  
  - `np.random.rand()`, `np.random.randn()`, `np.random.randint()`  
  - Histograms with Pandas  

- ➕ **Mathematical Operations**  
  - Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
  - Power, square root, trigonometric functions  
  - Aggregations: `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.std()`, `.max()`, `.min()`  

- 📊 **Broadcasting**  
  - Operations between arrays of different shapes  
  - Row/column broadcasting  

- ✅ **Boolean Masking**  
  - Conditional selection (`arr > 3`, `arr % 2 == 0`)  
  - Extracting subsets based on conditions
